Law 32: Play to People’s Fantasies. The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant.

There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.

A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. They then dwell in the house next door, and at any moment a flame may dart out and set fire to his own house.

Quitting porn is the rite of passage for the modern young man. Ironically it's probably one of the hardest rites of passage of any society ever. Theirs were mostly physical or mental; hunting solo for the first time, fighting a battle, making an artisan piece, passing hard exams. Now our rite of passage is spiritual, defeating the beast within our very selves. To endure and turn away from the most temptation ever offered; endless amounts of freely available HD hardcore pornography. From learning to defeat this deepest darkness, we will climb higher than any of our forefathers.


What seems obvious to you that the rest of humanity hasn't figured out yet?
The most obvious one: reality isn't just "out there"; it's shaped by what we choose to perceive and act on. humanity endlessly debates objective vs. subjective truth, but the truth is: both co-create each other. people waste lifetimes seeking "meaning" or "truth" without realising they're the ones writing it.
Second: the future doesn't belong to the smartest or the strongest but to those who adapt quickest to chaos. most people are over-optimising stability in a world that rewards anti-fragility.
Third: the collective delusion that governments, corporations, or anyone else will save us. nobody is coming to rescue you. your life is yours to shape, and most systems are indifferent at best or parasitic at worst.
Also, the obvious sleeper-time isn't linear, it's exponential. people fail to grasp the compounding effects of their choices (or inactions) over time. this applies to everything: health, knowledge, wealth, relationships. small, consistent inputs beat grand gestures every time. And the real kicker: the universe doesn't care about you, but that's liberating, not nihilistic. it means you're free to matter as much as you decide.


After 37 years of age, l've finally come to realize the cure to depression to a man is just leaving the house at every single possible opportunity no matter how badly you don't want to.

You must break the pattern today or the loop will repeat tomorrow.


There is a point in the history of society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that among other things it sides even with those who harm it, criminals, and does this quite seriously and honestly. Punishing somehow seems unfair to it, and it is certain that imagining "punishment" and "being supposed to punish" hurts it, arouses fear in it. "Is it not enough to render him undangerous? Why still punish? Punishing itself is terrible." With this question, herd morality, the morality of timidity, draws its ultimate consequence. - Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil.


The way to love anything is to realise that it might be lost. - G. K Chesterton

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool l've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything-all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure-these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. - Steve Jobs


If you spend enough time with anything, you start liking it, even sadness. - Tripathi

Don't you wonder sometimes, what might have happened if you'd tried? - Ishiguro

It is impossible to feel anxious when your balls are full.


The Butterfly Effect, by srepoetry
You need to stay. And you need to stay loudly. You're afraid of making bad choices but the truth is this: the tiniest actions will influence the course of the rest of your life and you cannot control it. So many factors play a part in you being here today: a delayed train, an extra cup of tea, the number of seconds your parents took to cross the street. This is chaos theory.
Sensitivity. Mathematics. You are here. And every choice you have ever made has led you to right now, reading this. While you exist, every movement and moment matters; those bad choices led you to the best days of your life, if you were to play it all in rewind. Change will come, even if you're standing still. Butterflies will keep flapping their wings and causing hurricanes. So, make your choices and make them loud. Trust your gut. Trust energy. And if you ceased to exist? Oh, the universe would notice. The mess that would make. The hearts that would break. So just stay. Stay for bad choices. Stay for great ones. Stay. Cause a few hurricanes.


Because you deserve to get back just as much of the love you pour into the world.


My grandma said this morning, "If you're going through hell, keep going. Why would you stop in hell?" And that moved me.

Oceanic feeling.

Maybe it's more about intimacy, not sex.
Maybe it's more about connection, not attention.
Maybe it's more about depth, not variety.
Maybe it's more about being seen, not idolised.
Maybe it's more about facing yourself, not escaping.


Prehër, Αλβανικά. Εκείνη η επιφάνεια του μηρού ενός ανθρώπου που κάθεται, πάνω στην οποία όταν ξαπλώνεις το κεφάλι σου, ο σβέρκος σου εφαρμόζει τόσο ωραία, που σου δίνει μια αίσθηση ασφάλειας και ηρεμίας.


I believe sex isn't the most intimate thing, conversation is. If I give you my body, I can take it back. But if I give you my thoughts, you walk away with a real piece of me. You walk away with what's under my skin. You walk away with what l am intimate with myself about.


Something in me wants more. I can't rest. - Sylvia Plath


Life is fucking electric bro. Don't fall for the doomer shit. Thats for losers and normies scared of their own shadows. Walk around like God sent you and smile at everyone you see. Spread light and abundance. Build things and take chances. This is the best time in history! @dezgoldie

Effortlessness is the ultimate show of mastery.
Coolness captivates us because it hides the labor behind the spectacular, presenting us with the facade of an I-was-born-this-way genius.
Coolness is sexy because it carries the mythos that divine talent cannot be taught, only bestowed. It's messianic. It's a glimpse of transcendence, a break from the mundane and the toil of practice. Yes, that's me, God's favourite.
I do not look, I am looked at.


The seats are empty. The theatre is dark. why do you keep acting?


Modern men have to work 5x harder than their grandfathers did for women 20x worse than what their grandmothers were.
It’s called hoeflation. and its destroying western men's desires to be providers and protectors.


@normmacdonald
Neil, there is a logic flaw in your little aphorism that seems quite telling. Since you and I are part of the Universe, then we would also be indifferent and uncaring. Perhaps you forgot, Neil, that we are not superior to the Universe but merely a fraction of it. Nice day, indeed
Neil de Grasse Tyson & @neiltyson • 03 Apr 19
The Universe is blind to our sorrows and indifferent to our pains.
Have a nice day!

Knowledge isn't power until it's applied. - Dale Carnegie


I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”
― Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar

I killed a plant once because I gave it too much water. Lord, I worry that love is violence. - José Olivarez


I killed a plant once, with water and care, Too much of my love, too much to bear. I poured my heart in every drop, Till it drowned, and could not stop.
The leaves turned yellow, the stems grew weak, In my kindness, its life was bleak. Sometimes love, though well-intended, Needs a balance, or it's upended.
So I learned from that little green riend, That sometimes less is more, in the end. A gentle touch, a mindful gaze, Can nurture life in countless ways.


"A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it." - Jean De La Fontaine


Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance. The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of.


Objects stabilise human life insofar as they give it a continuity. The digital order de-objectifies the world. We no longer inhabit heaven and earth, but the Cloud and Google Earth. The world is becoming progressively untouchable, foggy and ghostly? -Byung Chul Han


The timidity of the child or the savage is entirely reasonable; they are alarmed at this world, because this world is a very alarming place. They dislike being alone because it is verily and indeed an awful idea to be alone. Barbarians fear the unknown for the same reason that Agnostics worship it-because it is a fact. Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.


A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies becomes unable to recognise truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal. And it all comes from lying - lying to others and to yourself. - Dostoyevsky 


Deep down. You know exactly where you stand with someone. Hope blurs the lines a bit but, you know.


And when nobody wakes you up in the morning, and when nobody waits for you at night, and when you can do what ever you want. What do you call it, freedom or loneliness?

Steadiness, calmness, a stable sense of self-confidence. The kind that allows them to express vulnerability without feeling destabilised, and to not be scared of the strength of their own emotions. Relatedly, good discernment. A moral compass oriented towards kindness.

I think I might need to come to terms with the possibility that I never find one. And I think of all the love I have to give I could give to that one person and If I don’t find them I’ll just spread it away to everybody else. And the world.


Burry me shallow, I’ll be back.


A water bottle at the store costs $1. The same bottle at a hotel is $3 and at an airport, $5. Same bottle, same brand. The only thing that changes is the place. Each place gives a different value to the same item. When you feel worthless, change places.

After copulation the Devi's laughter can be heard.


"Why do we feel it’s necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?" A very interesting and truthful question. Because there is anxiety and tension in the air, particularly if there is infatuation. This builds tension. Tension is released through human interaction : kissing, touching, laughing and of course talking about "bullshit" in order to be comfortable. I study human interaction, particularly relationships.


Without training, they lacked knowledge. Without knowledge, they lacked confidence. Without confidence, they lacked victory.


We don't care if you are offended. Offense is taken, not given.


Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. -Marcus Aurelius


At the end, we are humans drunk to the idea that love and only love can heal our brokenness.


All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone. - Pascal


The thought of death terrorises the young, and consoles the old, since the young are filled with hope, while the old are filled with regret.

My ancestors are smiling at me , imperials , can you say the same?


The numerator isn't shrinking. Rather, the denominator is expanding.

Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius. - Thiel

The bill for magical thinking comes with unpredictable timing but thunderous force.

Mentality of me entering the room. Every girl in here is starved for dick, and unfortunately I only have one.


Allow manipulation to find out where your enemy wants you to go, then use your mind to break the trap and punish the perpetrators.


Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.


That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.


We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.

Render onto Caesar what Is Caesars, and unto God what is Gods.


And when nobody wakes you up in the morning, and when nobody waits for you at night, and when you can do whatever you want. What do you call it, freedom or loneliness?

Κάποιος ρώτησε ένα σοφό γέρο: «Μα γιατί δεν μπορώ τελικά να κρατήσω ένα φίλο κοντά μου, αφού το θέλω τόσο πολύ;» Και ο σοφός του απάντησε: «Ακριβώς επειδή το θες πάρα πολύ». Η λαχτάρα για σχέση φαρμακώνεται από τη λαχτάρα για ταύτιση, για εξάρτηση, για προβολές, για ρούφηγμα, για χρήση εντέλει. Με τέτοιες ανάγκες για στόχους, δε συνδέεσαι. Συνεργάζεσαι μόνο για να ανταλλάσσεις αρρώστιες, παθογόνους ερεθισμούς και προφάσεις. Για να αποφεύγεις την πραγματικότητα σου που τρέμεις. Τέτοιες διαθέσεις σύντομα γίνονται αντιληπτές και κάνουν τον άλλον να ασφυκτιά και να απομακρύνεται. 'Όλες οι δυστυχίες του ανθρώπου απορρέουν απ' την ανικανότητα του να καθίσει σ' ένα δωμάτιο μόνος και σιωπηλός.

We said goodbye to our mothers. They'd been around all our lives, but we'd never properly seen them. They'd been bent over washing tubs or cooking pots, their faces red and swollen from heat and steam, holding everything together while our fathers were away at sea, and nodding off every night on the kitchen chair, with a darning needle in hand. It was their endurance and exhaustion we knew, rather than them. And we never asked them for anything because we didn't want to bother them.
That was how we showed our love: with silence. Their eyes were always red. In the morning, when they woke us up, it was from stove smoke. And in the evening, when they said good night to us, still dressed, it was from exhaustion. And sometimes it was from crying over someone who would never come home again. Ask us about the colour of a mother's eyes, and we'd reply, "They're not brown. They aren't green. They're neither blue nor gray. They're red." That's what we'd say. And now they've come down alongside the wharf to say goodbye. But between us, there's silence. Their eyes pierce us. "Come back," their stare pleads. "Don't leave us." But we won't be coming back. We want out. We want to get away. Our mother sticks a knife in our heart when we say goodbye on the wharf. And we stick a knife in hers when we go. And that's how we're connected: through the hurt we inflict on one another. - Carsten Jensen, We, The Drowned

I discovered that my obsession for having each thing in the right place, each subject at the right time,
each word in the right style, was not the well-deserved reward of an ordered mind but just the opposite: 
a complete system of pretence invented by me to hide the disorder of my nature. 
I discovered that I am not disciplined out of virtue but as a reaction to my negligence,
that I appear generous in order to conceal my meanness,
that I pass myself off as prudent because I am evil-minded,
that I am conciliatory in order not to succumb to my repressed rage,
that I am punctual only to hide how little I care about other people’s time.

A woman can grow to love a man, but a man either loves you from the start or doesn’t. I will not elaborate on this.
( The above was posed as a question and below is someones answer:
TLDR: No not really at all to be honest.
In my opinion and experience there’s a huge amount of factors that go into the overall state we call ‘love’. Initial attraction, meeting of minds, life and progressive growth , together. As someone who has intense OCD it means that I constantly analyze and asses my state of being. I would say rather confidently that it can be the same mess of grey areas on both sides. Due to my ocd i can be incredibly attracted to a person and then after time only see the flaws they hold and then after that passes an intense love takes over.
my answer like this question isn’t a straightforward black and white one. Because really life and love is the Grey area in between the two.)
